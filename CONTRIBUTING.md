# Contributing
Thanks for taking the time to contribute.

## Snippets
The easiest way to contribute is to submit a code snippet. The snippets are stored in [snippets/<language>](snippets/). They need to fullfil the following requirements. **Please ensure that these requirements are met before submitting a pull request.**
- Use literal tabs(not spaces) for indention.
- Have maximum 79 characters per line.
- Have no trailing newline.
- Be idiomatic and well written.
- Be moderately short.
- Be *interesting*. The code should either display the syntax of a language with a familiar, easily digestible example such as [fibonacci.cpp](https://github.com/olav35/liracer-rewrite/blob/master/snippets/c%2B%2B/fibonacci.cpp), [hello_world.hs](https://github.com/olav35/liracer-rewrite/blob/master/snippets/haskell/hello_world.hs) or [fibonacci_sequence.rb](https://github.com/olav35/liracer-rewrite/blob/master/snippets/ruby/fibonacci_sequence.rb), or be a real-life example.
- Be valid code. The code does not need to be self sufficient, but no syntax errors should be present.
- Be legitimate contributions(not spam garbage).
- Follow the language conventions listed below if your language has a section. Otherwise feel free to add your own. If language conventions conflict with the universal requirements, the universal requirements are prioritized.

For a start you can translate an already existing quote to a new language.

### Languages
#### C/C++
- Use snake_case for files, functions and variables.
- Use SCREAM_CASE for symbolic constants.
- Have function prototypes at the top, main function in the middle and other functions thereafter.
#### Haskell
- Use camelCase for files and functions.
- Use PascalCase for types.
#### Java
- Use PascalCase for files, classes and interfaces.
- Use camelCase for methods.
- Use SCREAM_CASE for constants.
#### JavaScript
- Use snake_case for files, functions and variables.
- Only use let and const (no var).
- Do not use trailing semicolons.
#### Python
- Use snake_case for files, functions and variable.
#### Ruby
